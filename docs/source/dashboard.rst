The Dashboard
=============

This chapter describes how to create a dashboard to quickly visualize data stored in a **signac** data space.
To install the **signac-dashboard** package, see :ref:`dashboard-installation`.

Getting Started
---------------

You can start a dashboard to visualize **signac** project data in the browser, by importing the :py:class:`~signac_dashboard.Dashboard` class and calling its :py:meth:`~signac_dashboard.Dashboard.main` method.

.. code-block:: python

    from signac_dashboard import Dashboard
    Dashboard().main()

Start a Dashboard
-----------------

The code below will open a dashboard for an newly-initialized (empty) project, with no jobs and one module loaded. Write the file ``dashboard.py`` with these contents:

.. code-block:: python

    from signac_dashboard import Dashboard
    from signac_dashboard.modules import ImageViewer

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        Dashboard(modules=[ImageViewer()]).main()

Then launch the dashboard with ``python dashboard.py run``.

Included Modules
----------------

For a list of available modules and usage instructions, see :ref:`python-api-dashboard-modules`.

Specifying a custom job title
-----------------------------

By creating a class that inherits from :py:class:`~signac_dashboard.Dashboard` (which we'll call ``MyDashboard``), we can begin to customize some of the functions that make up the dashboard, like :py:meth:`~signac_dashboard.Dashboard.job_title`, which gives a human-readable title to each job.

.. code-block:: python

    class MyDashboard(Dashboard):

        def job_title(self, job):
            return 'Concentration(A) = {}'.format(job.sp['conc_A'])

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        MyDashboard().main()

Running dashboards on a remote host
-----------------------------------

To use dashboards hosted by a remote computer, open an SSH tunnel to the remote computer and forward the port where the dashboard is hosted. For example, connect to the remote computer with

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh username@remote.server.org -L 8890:localhost:8888

to forward port 8888 on the host to port 8890 on your local computer.

Dissecting the Dashboard Structure
----------------------------------

- *Jobs* are how **signac** manages data. Each job has a statepoint (which contains job metadata) and a document (for persistent storage of key-value pairs). Jobs can be displayed in *list view* or *grid view*. The list view provides quick descriptions and status information from many jobs, while the grid view is intended to show text and media content from one or more jobs.
- *Templates* provide the HTML structure of the dashboard's pages, written in Jinja template syntax for rendering content on the server
- *Modules* are server-side Python code that interface with your **signac** data to display content. Generally, a module will render content from a specific *job* into a *card template*.
- *Cards* are a type of template that is shown in *grid view* and contains content rendered by a *module*.

Searching jobs
--------------

The search bar accepts JSON-formatted queries in the same way as the ``signac find`` command-line tool. For example, using the query ``{"key": "value"}`` will return all jobs where the job statepoint ``key`` is set to ``value``. To search jobs by their document key-value pairs, use ``doc:`` before the JSON-formatted query, like ``doc:{"key": "value"}``.
