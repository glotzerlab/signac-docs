.. It's necessary to have a file that creates the bibliography that is
   processed by Sphinx AFTER all of the :cite: commands have been parsed. To
   fix this, we name this file "zreferences.rst" so that it comes as late as
   possible and import the bibliography here.

.. bibliography:: signac.bib
