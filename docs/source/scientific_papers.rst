- *Scalable Screening of Soft Matter: A Case Study of Mixtures of Ionic Liquids and Organic Solvents* :cite:`Thompson2019`

  Molecular dynamics simulations of room-temperature ionic liquids spanning 396 state points: 18 compositions by mass fraction and 22 unique solvents from five chemical families (nitriles, alcohols, halocarbons, carbonyls, and glymes). Simulations performed using GROMACS.

- *GW100: Comparison of Methods and Accuracy of Results Obtained with the WEST Code* :cite:`Govoni2018`

  Validation study using five different codes to compute the vertical ionization potential and electron affinities of 100 molecules with the :math:`G_0W_0` approximation. Simulations performed using BerkeleyGW, FHI-aims, TURBOMOLE, VASP, and WEST.

- *Routine million-particle simulations of epoxy curing with dissipative particle dynamics* :cite:`Thomas2018`

  4,480 molecular dynamics simulations of epoxy curing, each containing millions of particles. Simulations performed using HOOMD-blue.

- *Inverse design of simple pair potentials for the self-assembly of complex structures* :cite:`Adorf2018`

  Uses relative entropy minimization in Fourier space to identify isotropic particle interaction potentials that result in self-assembly of various crystal structures. Simulations performed using HOOMD-blue.

- *The diversity of three-dimensional photonic crystals* :cite:`Cersonsky2021`

  Identifies photonic band gaps over a space of 151,593 crystal structures. Simulations performed using MIT Photonic Bands (MPB).

- *Efficient implementation of atom-density representations* :cite:`Musil2021`

  Benchmarking atom-density representations for use in machine learning. Data generated using librascal.

- *Cross-stream migration of a Brownian droplet in a polymer solution under Poiseuille flow* :cite:`Howard2019`

  Simulating fluid flow in polymer solutions as a function of chain length :math:`M`, polymer concentration :math:`\phi_p`, body force :math:`f_x`, and droplet viscosity :math:`\mu_d`. Simulations performed using HOOMD-blue.

- *Design of optical metamaterials* :cite:`Harper2020`

  Electromagnetic simulations of silicon cylinders on a SiO\ :sub:`2` substrate are performed using RCWA and managed via **signac**. The resulting data is used in a machine learning model using TensorFlow to predict optical properties.
