Welcome to the signac framework documentation!
==============================================

The **signac** framework supports researchers in managing project-related data with a well-defined indexable storage layout for data and metadata.
This streamlines post-processing and analysis and makes data collectively accessible.

This is the overall **framework documentation**.
It provides a comprehensive overview on what you can do with packages that are part of the **signac** framework.
If you are new to **signac**, the best place to start is to read the :ref:`introduction` and the :ref:`tutorial`.
