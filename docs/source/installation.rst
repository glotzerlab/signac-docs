The **signac** framework consists of **signac**, **signac-flow**, **signac-dashboard**, and **synced_collections**.
The **synced_collections** package is a standalone package containing data structures used by the core **signac** package.
All other packages in the **signac** framework depend on **signac** core, which provides the data management functionality used by all other packages.
Most users should install the **signac** and **signac-flow** packages, which are tested for Python 3.8+ and are built for all major platforms.
For more details about the functionalities of individual packages, please see :ref:`package-overview`.


Install with conda
==================

The recommended installation method for installing **signac** packages is *via* conda_.
The **signac** packages are distributed *via* the conda-forge_ channel.
For a standard installation, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge signac signac-flow

.. tip::

    Consider adding the conda-forge_ channel to your default channels with: ``$ conda config --add channels conda-forge``.
