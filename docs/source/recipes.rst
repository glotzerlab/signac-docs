How to migrate (change) the data space schema.
==============================================

Adding/renaming/deleting keys
-----------------------------

Oftentimes, one discovers at a later stage that important keys are missing from the metadata schema.
For example, in the tutorial we are modeling a gas using the ideal gas law, but we might discover later that important effects are not captured using this overly simplistic model and decide to replace it with the van der Waals equation:

.. math::

   \left(p + \frac{N^2 a}{V^2}\right) \left(V - Nb \right) = N k_B T

Since the ideal gas law can be considered a special case of the equation above with :math:`a=b=0`, we could migrate all jobs with:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for job in project:
    ...     job.sp.setdefault('a', 0)
    ...     job.sp.setdefault('b', 0)
    ...

The ``setdefault()`` function sets the value for :math:`a` and :math:`b` to 0 in case that they are not already present.

 * To *delete* a key use ``del job.sp['key_to_be_removed']``.
 * To *rename* a key, use ``job.sp.new_name = job.sp.pop('old_name')``.

.. note::

    The ``job.sp`` and ``job.doc`` attributes provide all basic functions  of a regular Python dict.


.. _document-wide-migration:

Initializing Jobs with Replica Indices
--------------------------------------
If you want to initialize your workspace with multiple instances of the same statepoint, you may want to include a **replica_index** or **random_seed** parameter in the statepoint.

.. code-block:: python

    num_reps = 3
    for i in range(num_reps) :
        for p in range(1, 11):
            sp = {'p': p, 'kT': 1.0, 'N': 1000, "replica_index": i}
            job = project.open_job(sp)
            job.init()



Apply document-wide changes
---------------------------

The safest approach to apply multiple document-wide changes is to replace the document in one operation.
Here is an example on how we could recursively replace all dot (.)-characters with the underscore-character in **all** keys [#f1]_:

.. code-block:: python

    import signac
    from collections.abc import Mapping


    def migrate(doc):
        if isinstance(doc, Mapping):
            return {k.replace('.', '_'): migrate(v) for k, v in doc.items()}
        else:
            return doc

    for job in signac.get_project():
        job.sp = migrate(job.sp)
        job.doc = migrate(job.doc)

This approach makes it also easy to compare the pre- and post-migration states before actually applying them.

.. [#f1] The use of dots in keys is deprecated. Dots will be exclusively used to denote nested keywords in the future.

How to initialize with replica indices
======================================

We often require multiple jobs with the same statepoint to collect enough information to make statistical inferences about the data. Instead of creating multiple projects to handle this, we can simply add a **replica_index** to the statepoint. For example, we can use the following code to generate 3 copies of each statepoint in a workspace:

.. code-block:: python

    # init.py
    import signac

    project = signac.init_project('ideal-gas-project')
    num_reps = 3

    jobs = project.find_jobs({"replica_index.$exists": False})
    for job in jobs:
        job.sp['replica_index'] = 0

    for i in range(num_reps):
        for p in range(1, 11):
            sp = {'p': p, 'kT': 1.0, 'N': 1000, "replica_index": i}
            project.open_job(sp).init()

How to define parameter-dependent operations
============================================

Operations defined as a function as part of a **signac-flow** workflow can only have one required argument: the job.
That is to ensure reproduciblity of these operations.
An operation should be a true function of the job's data without any hidden parameters.

Here we show how to define operations that are a function of one or more additional parameters without violating the above mentioned principle.
Assuming that we have an operation called *foo*, which depends on parameter *bar*, here is how we could implement multiple operations that depend on that additional parameter without code duplication:

.. code-block:: python

    class Project(FlowProject):
        pass


    def add_foo_workflow(bar):

        job.doc.setdefault('foo', dict())

        def foo_ran(job):
            return bar in job.doc.foo

        # Make sure to make the operation-name a function of the parameter(s)!
        @Project.operation('foo-{})'.format(bar))
        @Project.post(foo_ran)
        def foo(job):
            job.doc.foo[bar] = 'hello world!'


   for bar in (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42):
       add_foo_workflow(bar=bar)


.. note::

    The operation and condition functions must be defined in a way such that they are **truly independent** from eachother!
    For instance, the example above would fail if all *foo*-operations had the same name or if they were all writing output to the same location.

How to integrate signac-flow with MATLAB or other software without Python interface
===================================================================================

The easiest way to integrate software that has no native Python interface is to implement **signac-flow** operations in combination with the ``flow.cmd`` decorator.
Assuming that we have a MATLAB script called ``prog.m`` within the project root directory:

.. code-block:: matlab

    % prog.m
    function []=prog(arg1, arg2)

    display(arg1);
    display(arg2);

    exitcode = 0;

Then, we could implement a simple operation that passes it some metadata parameters like this:

.. code-block:: python

    @FlowProject.operation
    @flow.cmd
    def compute_volume(job):
        return "matlab -r 'prog {job.sp.foo} {job.sp.bar}' > {job.ws}/output.txt"

Executing this operation will store the output of the matlab script within the job's workspace within a file called ``output.txt``.

.. todo::

    Show how to use signac to initialize from the command line, or point to the signac docs for doing this.
    Clarify that in principle the only Python needed is the definition of the bash command as a string returned from a decorated Python function.


How to implement MPI-parallelized operations
============================================

There are basically two strategies to implement :class:`~.flow.FlowProject` operations that are MPI-parallelized, one for external programs and one for Python scripts.

.. tip::

    Fully functional scripts can be found in the signac-docs repository under ``examples/MPI``.


MPI-operations with mpi4py or similar
-------------------------------------

Assuming that your operation is using `mpi4py`_ or similar, you do not have to change your code:

.. _mpi4py: http://mpi4py.scipy.org/docs/

.. code-block:: python

    @FlowProject.operation
    def hello_mpi(job):
        from mpi4py import MPI
        print("Hello from rank", MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_rank())

You could run this operation directly with: ``mpiexec -n 2 python project.py run -o hello_mpi``.

.. note::

    This strategy might fail in cases where you cannot ensure that the MPI communicator is initialized *within* the operation function.

.. danger::

    Read and write operations to the **job-/ and project-document** are not protected
    against race-conditions and should only be executed on one rank at a time.
    This can be ensured for example like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        from mpi4py import MPI
        comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD

        if comm.Get_rank() == 0:
            job.doc.foo = 'abc'
        comm.barrier()


MPI-operations with ``flow.cmd``
--------------------------------

Alternatively, you can implement an MPI-parallelized operation with the ``flow.cmd`` decorator, optionally in combination with the ``flow.directives`` decorator.
This strategy lets you define the number of ranks directly within the code and is also the only possible strategy when integrating external programs without a Python interface.

Assuming that we have an MPI-parallelized program named ``my_program``, which expects an input file as its first argument and which we want to run on two ranks, we could implement the operation like this:

.. code-block:: python

    @FlowProject.operation
    @flow.cmd
    @flow.directives(np=2)
    def hello_mpi(job):
        return "mpiexec -n 2 mpi_program {job.ws}/input_file.txt"

The ``flow.cmd`` decorator instructs **signac-flow** to interpret the operation as a command rather than a Python function.
The ``flow.directives`` decorator provides additional instructions on how to execute this operation and is not strictly necessary for the example above to work.
However, some script templates, including those designed for HPC cluster submissions, will use the value provided by the ``np`` key to compute the required compute ranks for a specific submission.

.. todo::
    Once we have templates documentation, point to it here.
    Clarify that np is just a flow convention.

.. tip::

  You do not have to *hard-code* the number of ranks, it may be a function of the job, *e.g.*: ``flow.directives(np=lambda job: job.sp.system_size // 1000)``.


MPI-operations with custom script templates
-------------------------------------------

Finally, instead of modifying the operation implementation, you could use a custom script template, such as this one:

.. code-block:: bash

    {% extends base_script %}
    {% block body %}
    {% for operation in operations %}
    mpiexec -n {{ operation.directives.np }} operation.cmd
    {% endfor %}
    {% endblock %}

Storing the above template in a file called ``templates/script.sh`` within your project root directory will prepend *every* operation command with ``mpiexec`` and so on.


How to run in containerized environments
========================================

.. _docker: https://www.docker.com/
.. _singularity: http://singularity.lbl.gov/

Using **signac-flow** in combination with container systems such as docker_ or singularity_ is easily achieved by modifying the ``executable`` *directive*.
For example, assuming that we wanted to use a singularity container named ``software.simg``, which is placed within the project root directory, we use the following directive to specify that a given operation is to be executed within then container:

.. code-block:: jinja

    @Project.operation
    @flow.directives(executable='singularity exec software.simg python')
    def containerized_operation(job):
        pass

If you are using the ``run`` command for execution, simply execute the whole script in the container:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ singularity exec software.simg python project.py run


.. attention::

    Many cluster environments will not allow you to **submit** jobs to the scheduler using the container image.
    This means that the actual submission, (e.g. ``python project.py submit`` or similar) will need to be executed with a **local** Python executable.

    To avoid issues with dependencies that are only available in the container image, move imports into the operation function.
    Condition functions will be executed during the submission process to determine *what* to submit, so depedencies for those must be installed into the local environment as well.

.. tip::

    You can define a decorator that can be reused like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        def on_container(func):
            return flow.directives(executable='singularity exec software.simg python')(func)


        @on_container
        @Project.operation
        def containerized_operation(job):
            pass
