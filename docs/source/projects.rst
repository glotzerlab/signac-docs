Introduction
============

For a full reference of the Project API, please see the :ref:`Python API
<python-api-project>`.

A **signac** project is a conceptual entity consisting of three components:

  1. a **data space**,
  2. **scripts and routines** that operate on that space, and
  3. the project's **documentation**.

This division corresponds largely to the definition of a computational project outlined by `Wilson et al.`_
The primary function of **signac** is to provide a single interface between component **(2)**, the scripts encapsulating the project logic, and component **(1)**, the underlying data generated and manipulated by these operations.
By maintaining a clearly defined data space that can be easily indexed, **signac** can provide a consistent, homogeneous data access mechanism.
In the process, **signac**'s maintenance of the data space also effectively functions as an implicit part of component **(3)**, the project's documentation.

.. _project-initialization:

Project Initialization
======================

In order to use **signac** to manage a project's data, the project must be **initialized** as a **signac** project.
After a project has been initialized in **signac**, all shell and Python scripts executed within or below the project's root directory have access to **signac**'s central facility, the **signac** project interface.
The project interface provides simple and consistent access to the project's underlying *data space*. [#f1]_

.. [#f1] You can access a project interface from other locations by explicitly specifying the root directory.

To initialize a project, simply execute ``$ signac init <project-name>`` on the command line inside the desired project directory (create a new project directory if needed).
For example, to initialize a **signac** project named *MyProject* in a directory called ``my_project``, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir my_project
    $ cd my_project
    $ signac init MyProject

You can alternatively initialize your project within Python with the :py:func:`~signac.init_project` function:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> project = signac.init_project('MyProject')

This will create a configuration file which contains the name of the project.
The directory that contains this configuration file is the project's root directory.

.. _project-data-space:

The Data Space
==============

The project data space is stored in the *workspace directory*.
By default this is a sub-directory within the project's root directory named *workspace*.
Once a project has been initialized, any data inserted into the data space will be stored within this directory.
This association is not permanent; a project can be reassociated with a new workspace at any time, and it may at times be beneficial to maintain multiple separate workspaces for a single project.
You can access your signac :py:class:`~signac.Project` and the associated *data space* from within your project's root directory or any subdirectory from the command line:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ signac project
    MyProject

Or with the :py:func:`~signac.get_project` function:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import signac
    >>> project = signac.get_project()
    >>> print(project)
    MyProject

.. image:: images/signac_data_space.png

.. _project-jobs:

.. currentmodule:: signac.contrib.job

Jobs
----

The central assumption of the **signac** data model is that the *data space* is divisible into individual data points, consisting of data and metadata, which are uniquely addressable in some manner.
Specifically, the workspace is divided into sub-directories, where each directory corresponds to exactly one :py:class:`Job`.
Each job has a unique address, which is referred to as a *state point*.
A job can consist of any type of data, ranging from a single value to multiple terabytes of simulation data; **signac**'s only requirement is that this data can be encoded in a file.

A job is essentially just a directory on the file system, which is part of a *project workspace*.
That directory is called the *job workspace* and contains **all data** associated with that particular job.

You access a job by providing a *state point*, which is a unique key-value mapping describing your data.
All data associated with your job should be a unique function of the *state point*, e.g., the parameters that go into your physics or machine learning model.
For example, to store data associated with particular temperature or pressure of a simulation, you would first initialize a project, and then *open* a job like this:

.. code-block:: python

    project = get_project('path/to/my_project')
    job = project.open_job({'temperature': 20, 'pressure': 1.0})
    job.init()
    with open(job.fn('results.txt')) as file:
        ...

.. tip::

    You only need to call the :meth:`Job.init` function the first time that you are accessing a job.
    Furthermore, the :meth:`Job.init` function returns itself, so you can abbreviate like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        job = project.open_job({'temperature': 20, 'pressure': 1.0}).init()

The job *state point* represents a **unique address** of your data within one project.
There can never be two jobs that share the same *state point* within the same project.
Any other kind of data and metadata that describe your job, but do not represent a unique address should be stored within the :attr:`Job.doc`, which has the exact same interface like the :attr:`Job.sp`, but does not represent a unique address of the job.

.. tip::

    The :class:`Job` interface and the various methods of storing data are described in detail in the :ref:`jobs` section.

In addition to obtaining a job handle via the project ``open_job()`` function, you can also access it directly with the :func:`signac.get_job` function.
For example, you can get a handle on a job by switching into the workspace directory and then calling :func:`signac.get_job`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import signac
    >>> job = signac.get_job()
    >>> print(job)
    42b7b4f2921788ea14dac5566e6f06d0

.. _project-job-finding:

Finding jobs
------------

.. currentmodule:: signac

In general, you can iterate over all initialized jobs using the following idiom:

.. code-block:: python

    for job in project:
        pass

This notation is shorthand for the following snippet of code using the :py:meth:`Project.find_jobs` method:

.. code-block:: python

    for job in project.find_jobs():
        pass

However, the :py:meth:`~signac.Project.find_jobs` interface is much more powerful in that it allows filtering for subsets of jobs.
For example, to iterate over all jobs that have a *state point* parameter ``b=0``, execute:

.. code-block:: python

    for job in project.find_jobs({'b': 0}):
        pass

For more information on how to search for specific jobs in Python and on the command line, please see the :ref:`query` chapter.

.. _project-job-grouping:

Grouping
--------

Grouping operations can be performed on the complete project data space or the results of search queries, enabling aggregated analysis of multiple jobs and state points.

The return value of the :py:meth:`~Project.find_jobs()` method is a cursor that we can use to iterate over all jobs (or all jobs matching an optional filter if one is specified).
This cursor is an instance of :py:class:`~signac.contrib.project.JobsCursor` and allows us to group these jobs by state point parameters, the job document values, or even arbitrary functions.

.. note::

    The :py:meth:`~signac.Project.groupby` method is very similar to Python's built-in :py:func:`itertools.groupby` function.


Basic Grouping by Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Grouping can be quickly performed using a statepoint or job document key.

If *a* was a state point variable in a project's parameter space, we can quickly enumerate the groups corresponding to each value of *a* like this:

.. code-block:: python

    for a, group in project.groupby('a'):
        print(a, list(group))

Similarly, we can group by values in the job document as well. Here, we group all jobs in the project by a job document key *b*:

.. code-block:: python

    for b, group in project.groupbydoc('b'):
        print(b, list(group))


Grouping by Multiple Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Grouping by multiple state point parameters or job document values is possible, by passing an iterable of fields that should be used for grouping.
For example, we can group jobs by state point parameters *c* and *d*:

.. code-block:: python

    for (c, d), group in project.groupby(('c', 'd')):
        print(c, d, list(group))


Searching and Grouping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can group a data subspace by combining a search with a group-by function.
As an example, we can first select all jobs, where the state point key *e* is equal to 1 and then group them by the state point parameter *f*:

.. code-block:: python

    for f, group in project.find_jobs({'e': 1}).groupby('f'):
        print(f, list(group))


Custom Grouping Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can group jobs by essentially arbitrary functions.
For this, we define a function that expects one argument and then pass it into the :py:meth:`~signac.Project.groupby` method.
Here is an example using an anonymous *lambda* function as the grouping function:

.. code-block:: python

    for (d, count), group in project.groupby(lambda job: (job.sp['d'], job.document['count'])):
        print(d, count, list(group))


.. _project-job-move-copy-remove:

Moving, Copying and Removal
---------------------------

In some cases it may desirable to divide or merge a project data space.
To **move** a job to a different project, use the :py:meth:`~signac.contrib.job.Job.move` method:

.. code-block:: python

    other_project = get_project(root='/path/to/other_project')

    for job in jobs_to_move:
        job.move(other_project)

**Copy** a job from a different project with the :py:meth:`~signac.Project.clone` method:

.. code-block:: python

    project = get_project()

    for job in jobs_to_copy:
        project.clone(job)

Trying to move or copy a job to a project which has already an initialized job with the same *state point*, will trigger a :py:class:`~signac.errors.DestinationExistsError`.

.. warning::

    While **moving** is a cheap renaming operation, **copying** may be much more expensive since all of the job's data will be copied from one workspace into the other.

To **clear** all data associated with a specific job, call the :py:meth:`~signac.contrib.job.Job.clear` method.
Note that this function will do nothing if the job is uninitialized; the :py:meth:`~signac.contrib.job.Job.reset` method will also clear all data associated with a job, but it will also automatically initialize the job if it was not originally initialized.
To **permanently delete** a job and its contents use the :py:meth:`~signac.contrib.job.Job.remove` method:

.. code-block:: python

    job = project.open_job(statepoint)
    job.remove()
    assert job not in project

.. _project-data:

Centralized Project Data
========================

To support the centralization of project-level data, **signac** offers simple facilities for placing data at the project level instead of associating it with a specific job.
For one, **signac** provides a *project document* and *project data* analogous to the :ref:`job document <project-job-document>` and :ref:`job data <project-job-data>`.
The project document is stored in JSON format in the project root directory and can be used to store similar types of data to the job document.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> project = signac.get_project()
    >>> project.doc['hello'] = 'world'
    >>> print(project.doc().get('hello'))
    'world'
    >>> print(project.doc.hello)
    'world'

The project data is stored in HDF5 format in a file named ``signac_data.h5`` in the project root directory.
Although it can be used to store similar types of data as the job document, it is meant for storage of large, array-like or dictionary-like information.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> project = signac.get_project()
    >>> project.data['x'] = np.ones([10, 3, 4])

Data may be accessed as an attribute, key, or through a functional interface:

To access data as an attribute:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> with project.data:
    ...     x = project.data.x[:]

To access data as a key:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> with project.data:
    ...     x = project.data['x'][:]

To access data through a functional interface:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> with project.data:
    ...     x = project.data.get('x')[:]

.. currentmodule:: signac.contrib.job

In addition, **signac** also provides the :py:meth:`signac.Project.fn` method, which is analogous to the :py:meth:`Job.fn` method described above:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print(project.root_directory())
    '/home/johndoe/my_project/'
    >>> print(project.fn('foo.bar'))
    '/home/johndoe/my_project/foo.bar'

.. _schema-detection:

Schema Detection
================

While **signac** does not require you to specify an *explicit* state point schema, it is always possible to deduce an *implicit* semi-structured schema from a project's data space.
This schema is comprised of the set of all keys present in all state points, as well as the range of values that these keys are associated with.

Assuming that we initialize our data space with two state point keys, ``a`` and ``b``, where ``a`` is associated with some set of numbers and ``b`` contains a boolean value:

.. code-block:: python

    for a in range(3):
        for b in (True, False):
            project.open_job({'a': a, 'b': b}).init()


Then we can use the :py:meth:`~signac.Project.detect_schema` method to get a basic summary of keys within the project's data space and their respective range:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print(project.detect_schema())
    {
     'a': 'int([0, 1, 2], 3)',
     'b': 'bool([False, True], 2)',
    }

This functionality is also available directly from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ signac schema
    {
     'a': 'int([0, 1, 2], 3)',
     'b': 'bool([False, True], 2)',
    }

.. _import-export:

Importing and Exporting Data
============================

Data archival is important to preserving the integrity, utility, and shareability of a project.
To this end, **signac** provides interfaces for importing workspaces from and exporting workspaces to directories, zip-files, and tarballs.
The exported project archives are useful for publishing data, *e.g.*, for researchers wishing to make an original data set available alongside a publication.

.. _data-export:

Exporting a Workspace
---------------------

Exporting a project could be as simple as zipping the project files and workspace paths (``$ zip -r project_archive.zip /data/my_project/``).
The functionality provided by ``signac export`` is a bit more fine-grained and allows the use of a custom path structure or the export of a subset of the jobs based on state point or document filters or by job id.

For example, suppose we have a project stored locally in the path ``/data/my_project`` and want to export it to a directory ``/data/my_project_archive``.
The project's jobs are assumed to have state point keys *a* and *b* with integer values.
We would first change into the root directory of the project that we want to export and then call ``signac export`` with the target path:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /data/my_project
    $ signac export /data/my_project_archive

This would **copy** data from the source project to the export directory with the following directory structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    /data/my_project_archive/a/0/b/0/
    /data/my_project_archive/a/0/b/1/
    /data/my_project_archive/a/0/b/2/
    # etc.

The default path function is based on the implicit schema of all exported jobs, but we can also **optionally** specify a specific export path, for example like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ signac export /data/my_project_archive "a_{a}/b_{b}"

It is possible to directly export to a zip-file or tarball by simply providing the path to the archive-file as target (*e.g.* ``$ signac export /data/my_project_archive.zip``).
For more details on how to use ``signac export``, type ``$ signac export --help`` or see the documentation for the :py:meth:`~signac.Project.export_to` method.

.. _data-import:

Importing a Data Space
----------------------

The import of data spaces into a **signac** workspace means to map all directories as part of an arbitrary directory structure to signac job state points.
That is easiest when one imports a previously exported workspace, which will still contain all state point files.

For example, we could first export our workspace in ``~/my_project`` to ``~/data/`` with

.. code-block:: bash

    ~/my_project $ signac export ~/data/

and then import the exported data into a second project:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~/my_new_project $ signac import ~/data/

Since the imported data space was previously exported with **signac**, all state point metadata is automatically determined from the state point manifest files.

In the case that we want to import a data space that was not previously exported with **signac**, we need to provide a schema-function.
In the simplest case, that is just a function based on the data space paths, *e.g.*,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ signac import /data/non_signac_archive "a_{a:int}/b_{b:int}"

The command above will copy all data from the the ``/data/non_signac_archive`` directory and use the paths of sub-directories to identify the associated state points.
For example, the path ``a_0/b_1`` will be interpreted as ``{'a': 0, 'b': 1}``.
The type specification -- here ``int`` for both *a* and *b* -- is optional and means that these values are converted to type ``int``; the default type is ``str``.

Importing from zip-files and tarballs works similarly, by specifying that path as the origin.
For more details on how to use ``signac import``, type ``$ signac import --help`` or see the documentation for :py:meth:`~signac.Project.import_from`.

.. _workspace-views:

Linked Views
============

Data space organization by job id is both efficient and flexible, but the obfuscation introduced by the job id makes inspecting the workspace on the command line or *via* a file browser much harder.
A *linked view* is a directory hierarchy with human-interpretable names that link to to the actual job workspace directories.
Unlike the default mode for :ref:`data export <data-export>`, no data is copied for the generation of linked views.

.. automethod:: signac.Project.create_linked_view
   :noindex:

To create views from the command line use the ``$ signac view`` command.

.. important::

    When the project data space is changed by adding or removing jobs, simply update the view, by executing :py:meth:`~signac.Project.create_linked_view` or ``$ signac view`` for the same view directory again.

You can limit the *linked view* to a specific data subset by providing a set of *job ids* to the :py:meth:`~signac.Project.create_linked_view` method.
This works similar for ``$ signac view`` on the command line, but here you can also specify a filter directly:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ signac view -f a 0

will create a linked view for all jobs, where ``a=0``.


.. _synchronization:

Synchronization
===============

In some cases it may be necessary to store a project at more than one location, perhaps for backup purposes or for remote execution of data space operations.
In this case there will be a regular need to synchronize these data spaces.

Synchronization of two projects can be accomplished by either using ``rsync`` to directly synchronize the respective workspace directories, or by using ``signac sync``, a tool designed for more fine-grained synchronization of project data spaces.
Users who are familiar with ``rsync`` will recognize that most of the core functionality and API of ``rsync`` is replicated in ``signac sync``.

As an example, let's assume that we have a project stored locally in the path ``/data/my_project`` and want to synchronize it with ``/remote/my_project``.
We would first change into the root directory of the project that we want to synchronize data into.
Then we would call ``signac sync`` with the path of the project that we want to *synchronize with*:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /data/my_project
    $ signac sync /remote/my_project

This would copy data *from the remote project to the local project*.
For more details on how to use ``signac sync``, type ``$ signac sync --help``.

Projects can also be synchronized using the Python API:

.. code-block:: python

    project.sync('/remote/my_project')
