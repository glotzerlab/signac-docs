Examples are provided as `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`__ notebooks in a separate
`signac-examples <https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-examples>`__ repository.
These notebooks may be launched
`interactively on Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/glotzerlab/signac-examples/main?filepath=notebooks%2Findex.ipynb>`__
or downloaded and run on your own system.

This is a collection of example projects which are designed to illustrate how to implement certain applications and solutions with **signac**.
Unlike the tutorial, the examples consist mainly of complete, immediately executable source code with less explanation.

Workflow Examples
=================

The sections within this chapter introduce the **signac** framework and demonstrate how to implement a simple, but complete computational workflow.
