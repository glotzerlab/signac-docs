Examples are provided as `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebooks in a separate
`signac-examples <https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac-examples>`_ repository.
These notebooks may be launched `interactively on Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/glotzerlab/signac-examples/master?filepath=index.ipynb>`_
or downloaded and run on your own system.
Visualization of data is done via `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and `Bokeh <https://bokeh.pydata.org/>`_, unless otherwise noted.

This is a collection of example projects which are designed to illustrate how to implement certain applications and solutions with **signac**.
Unlike the tutorial, the examples consist mainly of complete, immediately executable source code with less explanation.
